My CKAD Certification experience
I have just passed CKAD (Certifies Kubernetes Application Developer) exam in this month June’2020, well utilised my Corona lockdown time! It was really a race against time! It’a fast paces, exciting online coding exam!
I would like to share my experience, hope it will be helpful for you.

It’s an open book exam, however you can only browse Kubernetes offiical website and their related blogs. You can’t Google search and find the answers. You can copy and paste Yaml code from K8s official portal.
